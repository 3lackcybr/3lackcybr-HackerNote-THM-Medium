## **Task 1 Reconnaissance**
using the nmap tool in my kali linux to find the primary information about the machine . Here the command below
![machine 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8d69110-ebf7-4cf6-a2c8-e8cfda0fe9c7)


*QN 1: Which ports are open? (in numerical order)* 

  - 22 , 80 , 8080 .
    
*QN 2 : What programming language is the backend written in?*[[]]

- go

## Task 2: Investigate

Now  after that we know what's running, we need to investigate. With webapps, the normal process is to click around. Create an account, use the web app as a user would and play close attention to details.

   2. Log in to your account

    ![machine 10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abd1868b-c962-4e25-be1d-dcb85f185af6)

     
 Notice the timing difference. This allows user enumeration. 
 
 *A **timing attack*** is a technique where an attacker measures **how long a system takes to respond** to different inputs â€” and uses this information to **guess secrets like usernames or passwords**.

## ** Task 3: Service Enumeration:**
Using **dirsearch** tool in kali linux to discovered Directories/Files: in the domain http://10.10.124.211/ . 

![machine 11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ae5662e-fe76-43e7-8698-b1ca5eaf9e04)


**Findings:**

Discovered Directories/Files:

- `/index.html`
- `/not
-
## ## Vulnerability Analysis

After i created a test account and analyzed the responses for invalid usernames and passwords. Observed a timing delay when a valid username was used, enabling user enumeration.   An attacker can:

1. **Try many usernames.**
    
2. **Measure the response time.**
    
3. If the system takes **longer** to respond, it likely means the **username is valid** (because it took time to check the password).
    
4. Repeat the process with **passwords** to find the correct one.

We got the password **Hit** that will be our light to move forward with our attack. Using this hint we can craft or create a custom From this password hint, we can create a wordlist and (more) efficiently bruteforce the user's password.    

## Task 4: Attack Passwords

The HTTP POST request that we captured earlier tells us enough about the API that we can use **Hydra** to attack it.  
The API is actually designed to either accept Form data, or JSON data. The frontend sends JSON data as a POST request, so we will use this. Hydra allows attacking HTTP POST requests, with the HTTP-POST module.

- Using the hashcat-utilis to create a custom wordlist from the payload given in the lab.

## Task 5: Escalate

Now that we have an SSH session, we can grab the user flag. But that shouldn't be enough for us, we need root.  
A good first step for privilege escalation is seeing if you can run sudo.

Using the command *
			**sudo -l***
![machine 23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee0b114e-79d9-461f-93e3-0b5747faaa5b)

 
Unfortunately, the current user cannot run any commands as root. You may have noticed, however, that when you enter your password you see asterisks.

*QN: What is the CVE number for the exploit?*
- **CVE-2019-18634**

Let's find and download and exploit for that CVE, I found this one on [Github](https://github.com/saleemrashid/sudo-cve-2019-18634)
![machine 26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d2636ac-1b88-43d9-a39a-4dec4d20ef5b)


After download the exploit then we copy it to the vulnerable machine on ***/tmp*** directory since It's **writable by all users**, which means **any process**, including **unprivileged users**, can write to it.

## Comment 

 How to Prevent It:

- **Always respond in the same amount of time**, no matter if login is successful or not.
    
- Use **constant-time comparisons** for passwords.
    
- Add **rate limiting** or **CAPTCHAs**.
